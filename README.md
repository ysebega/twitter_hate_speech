# Twitter Hate Speech
This project about twitter dataset. It has tweets labelled as 0 (positive) and 1(negative or hate tweet). It has about 32000 observations and 3 features. The features are id, tweet and label (0 or 1). We intend to clean the data using regular expressions, tokenize the data, and preprocess it before using it in classification models, especially logistic regression. This is about combating hate speech on social media (twitter more especially) using natural language processing in conjunction with machine learning.
